## Objective

The objective of this project was to build predictive models to classify whether car insurance policyholders filed claims within six months of purchasing a car based on background information about the car and owner. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifteshanajnin/carinsuranceclaimprediction-classification?select=train.csv) we used came from a recent Kaggle competition and contains nearly 60,000 observations and 43 predictor variables related to information about the policyholders' cars and the policyholders themselves. The outcome variable is `is_claim`, which has two outcomes (yes and no) that indicates whether policyholders filed a claim within 6 months or not.
